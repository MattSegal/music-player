# Music Player

This app is intended for musicians who want to listen to a section of a song on repeat so that they can hear it better.

Users will be able to:

* upload and play songs from their browser
* pause, resume, restart
* 'zoom' into sections of a song, and loop that section
* slow down the song

It would be also nice to:

* pitch shift the song 
* apply custom frequency filters to the song
