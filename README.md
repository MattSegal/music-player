# Music Player

Live website [here](https://mattsegal.github.io/music-player)

This app is intended for musicians who want to listen to a section of a song on repeat so that they can hear it better.

Users will be able to:

* upload and play songs from their browser
* pause, resume, restart
* 'zoom' into sections of a song, and loop that section
* slow down the song

It would be also nice to:

* pitch shift the song 
* apply custom frequency filters to the song

# Development

Source files are in `src`, static files and build output are in `docs` (so that GitHub pages can find it).

To get started build the JavaScript:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the app in your browser via `/docs/index.html`
